Welcome to the BIOMENG321 Soft tissue mechanics labs. These instructions will take you through the following topics that are covered during these labs:

- :ref:`Lab 1: Deformation and stress in isotropic materials <lab1>` 

.. - Lab 2: Anisotropy and fibre (material) coordinates

The labs make use of the OpenCMISS computational modelling software that will be outlined in the next section.


.. define stress tensors with respect to spatial and material coordinates.
