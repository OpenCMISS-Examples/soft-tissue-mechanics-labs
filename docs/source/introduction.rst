Welcome to the soft tissue mechanics labs, which will take you through the following topics:

- :ref:`Lab 1: Analysing deformation and stresses in isotropic materials <lab1>` 

- :ref:`Lab 2a: Transforming stresses and strains between different coordinate systems <lab2a>`

- :ref:`Lab 2b: Analysing stresses in anisotropic materials <lab2b>`

These labs make use of the OpenCMISS computational modelling software that will be outlined in the next section.
