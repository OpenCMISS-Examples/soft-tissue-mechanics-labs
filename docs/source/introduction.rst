Welcome to the soft tissue mechanics labs, which will take you through the following topics:

- :ref:`Lab 1: Analysing deformation in isotropic materials <lab1>`

- :ref:`Lab 2a: Transforming stresses from 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff to Cauchy <lab2a>`

- :ref:`Lab 2b: Transforming stresses between different coordinate systems <lab2b>`

- :ref:`Lab 3: Analysing stresses in anisotropic materials <lab3>`

These labs make use of the OpenCMISS computational modelling software that will be outlined in the next section.
