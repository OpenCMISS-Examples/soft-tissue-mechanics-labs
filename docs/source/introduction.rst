Welcome to the Soft tissue mechanics labs. These instructions will take you through the following topics that are covered during these labs:

- :ref:`Lab 1: Deformation and stress in isotropic materials <lab1>` 

- :ref:`Lab 2: Transforming stresses and strains between different coordinate systems <lab2>`

These labs make use of the OpenCMISS computational modelling software that will be outlined in the next section.


.. define stress tensors with respect to spatial and material coordinates.
